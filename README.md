# MAD-OUTCOME
I successfully developed a deep learning-based skincare recommendation app and presented it at a prestigious model competition at SRM, earning a certificate of achievement. This innovative project utilized MobileNet, a lightweight CNN, fine-tuned with the Dermnet dataset for accurate skin type classification, and employed content-based filtering to recommend personalized skincare products. The mobile application allows users to upload images of their skin to receive real-time suggestions, enhancing user experience with a feedback loop for continuous improvement. This recognition highlights my ability to integrate AI with practical applications, delivering impactful and user-friendly solutions
